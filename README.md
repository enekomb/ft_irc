# ft_irc — IRC Server in C++

> 42 Urduliz — Common Core project

A fully functional **IRC server** built from scratch in C++, following the [RFC 1459](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459) protocol standard. Compatible with real IRC clients (irssi, HexChat, WeeChat).

## Features

- TCP/IP server using **non-blocking sockets** and `poll()` for concurrent connections
- Full **IRC protocol** support: `NICK`, `USER`, `JOIN`, `PART`, `PRIVMSG`, `KICK`, `INVITE`, `TOPIC`, `MODE`
- **Channel management**: multiple channels, operator and regular user roles
- **Server password** authentication
- Graceful disconnection and robust error handling

make
./ircserv <port> <password>
```

Connect with any IRC client:
```
/connect localhost <port> <password>
```
